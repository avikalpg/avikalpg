Hi, I'm Avikalp Gupta. I'm a software engineer (with AI/ML expertise) working on building products that help engineers build better products and live better lives.

### Primary Focus

#### Vibinex: The most intuitive interface for reviewing code changes

[Vibinex](https://vibinex.com) is a tool that helps you understand code changes 10x faster than going through the `git diff`.

As of 2024, it works as a GitHub app and a browser extension and helps you by creating an interactive visual graph representing the changes in the call-graph of the code.

### Favorite projects

- [typing-analyst](https://typing-analyst.vercel.app): MacOS tool that constantly measures typing speed and accuracy across applications and shows analytics.
- [free-time](https://myfreetimeinaweek.in): Proves to you that you have enough time to work on your hobby projects and passions; no matter how busy you claim yourself to be.
- [HustlerIDE](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vibinex.hustler): VSCode extension that asks you every day if you have talked to a user or spent any time marketing your project.
