Hi, I'm Avikalp Gupta. I'm a software engineer (with AI/ML expertise) working on building products that help engineers build better products and live better lives.

### Primary Focus

#### WildestAI: The understanding layer for AI-generated code changes

[WildestAI](https://wildestai.com) is a `git`-wrapper that unlocks the full potential of AI coding agents.
- Its diff (DiffGraph) helps you understand code changes 10x faster than going through the `git diff` when working on AI-generated code by creating an interactive visual graph representing the code changes.
- Its commit captures the prompts as metadata to retain the intent and line-of-thought across the SDLC.

### Favorite projects

- [Vibinex](https://vibinex.com): GitHub extension that makes code-reviews 5x faster using pull-request personalization, code-owner automation and integrated DiffGraphs. [Link to the source code](https://github.com/vibinex/vibinex)
- [WhatsApp AI Filter](https://whatsapp-ai-filter.vercel.app): Filters only the relevant messages from all the WhatsApp groups that you are a part of, into a single chat thread saving 95% of the time founders and influencers spend.
- [Skyline](https://skyline3d.in): View your GitHub contributions in 3D and order your 3D-printed skyline model to decorate your desk.
- [Alokit mentorship platform](https://alokit.in): Platform to conduct audition projects: short-term paid projects that are compensated based on completion rate.
- [free-time](https://myfreetimeinaweek.in): Proves to you that you have enough time to work on your hobby projects and passions; no matter how busy you claim yourself to be.
- [typing-analyst](https://typing-analyst.vercel.app): MacOS tool that constantly measures typing stats (speed/accuracy) across applications and shows analytics.
- [HustlerIDE](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vibinex.hustler): VSCode extension that asks you every day if you have talked to a user or spent any time marketing your project.
